This is a very simple CRUD web app I built to be self referential. It utilizes an authentication and registration system, allowing users to register
an account and create post that only they can see.

For API use, visit /api for a full list of API calls.

### What I used:

- Python

- Django

- Django Rest framework for API calls

- Bootstrap4 for CSS

- Docker
